            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

To drop ſome Tears, did I ſay? nay rather to pour water before the Lord, to weep Streams and Rivers, if it were poſſible, that we might at once bewail our own unva<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>luable Loſs in the untimely Death of ſo Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cellent a PRINCE, and the horrid ſin of thoſe
<pb n="2" facs="tcp:99498:3"/>men, <hi>(Scelus nullo Oceano eluendum)</hi> that were not content onely to pluck the Crown from the Head, but the Head from the Shoulders, and then glory in the committing of ſo great a Villany.<note place="margin">Jer. 9.1.</note> If the Prophet <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s grief ſwelled to that height as to wiſh his <hi>head all waters, and</hi> his <hi>eys a fountain of tears, that</hi> he <hi>might weep day and night for the ſlain of the Daughter of</hi> his <hi>people;</hi> ſure then we muſt not deſire to weep at a leſs rate for the Murther of a Father, the Father of our People and Country, whoſe Life was <hi>worth ten thouſand of ours.</hi>
               <note place="margin">2 Sam. 18.3.</note> But becauſe we are not able to dig the chanel of our Sorrow ſo <hi>deep</hi> as we could wiſh, it's ſome amends to draw it out at <hi>length;</hi> and therefore Authori<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty hath wiſely and piouſly provided, that the Tribute of our Tears ſhould be Anniverſary, and after a ſort eternal, by making Poſterity their Executors, to ſee this great Debt of Sor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>row diſcharged, and engaging all future Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rations to repair yearly to the houſe of Mourn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning; that ſo the Childrens Tears may help to ſupply the defects, and in due time fill up the vacuities of their Forefathers Sorrows.</p>
            <p>Let no man ſay, that it is againſt the Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects Liberty to pay this <hi>yearly Tax and Aſſeſſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment:</hi> It is but to give thee an occaſion to pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſent
<pb n="3" facs="tcp:99498:3"/>thy dead <hi>Sovereign</hi> with a Benevolence or Free gift, a ſmall Love-token, as a gage and earneſt of thy Fidelity and Loyalty to Him whilſt alive, that thy <hi>Soul never came into</hi> that dark <hi>Secret</hi> firſt, nor was thine <hi>Honour ever uni<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted</hi> to that Black <hi>Aſſembly</hi> afterwards, where <hi>the Rulers ſate in Councel againſt the Lord and his Anointed;</hi> but as formerly thy ſoul did weep in ſecret for the Pride and Treachery of the Enemie, (for thou wert then forced to be a Cloſe mourner) ſo now thou art not aſha<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med to appear abroad in the ſame Livery, and bleſs God that he hath given thee ſo fair an opportunity to expreſs thine Affection to thy <hi>dead Prince.</hi> Beſides, we want not precedents in Sacred Writ for an Anniverſary lamenting of great loſſes. For 70 years ſpace the <hi>Jews</hi> kept two yearly Faſting and mourning daies,<note place="margin">Zech. 7.5.</note> in memory of two ſore National Calamities; one; the Burning of the City and Temple, done in the <hi>fifth month;</hi> the other, the unfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tunate Murther of <hi>Gedaliah</hi> the ſon of <hi>Ahikam,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had ſet over the remnant of the <hi>Jews,</hi> done in the <hi>ſeventh month.</hi> Now if the <hi>Jews</hi> faſted and mourned ſeventy years for the untimely death of a Viceroy one<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly, one that was but the Lieutenant of the
<pb n="4" facs="tcp:99498:4"/>King of <hi>Babylon;</hi> certainly <hi>England</hi> may mourn twice ſeventy years for the Murther of her <hi>King;</hi> and if then ſhe think fit lay aſide her mourning weeds. But I believe it will be then thought reaſon and wiſedome to conti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nue the Sorrow, and to produce in publick our <hi>Joſeph</hi>'s Coat yearly, (for our <hi>Joſeph</hi> was <hi>ſold</hi> too, though not into <hi>the land of Egypt,</hi> yet into <hi>the Houſe of Bondage</hi>) I mean the Robe of our Sovereign died into Scarlet with His own Bloud; that Poſterity beholding with amaze<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment ſo rufull a ſpectacle, may paſsionately cry out with <hi>Jacob, Surely ſome evil Beaſt hath devoured him,</hi> to imagining Men, much leſs His Subjects, to have been ſo barbarous. And hereby they will not onely lament what is paſt, but likewiſe dread the thoughts of attempting the like Villany for the future.</p>
            <p>But why ſuch care taken to tranſmit to po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſterity the unfortunate end of CHARLES the Firſt, and not the like done for <hi>Edward</hi> and <hi>Richard</hi> both of that name the Second, whoſe lives cloſed with the like ſad Cataſtrophe, be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing both violently plucked from their Thrones, and hurried to an early Grave?</p>
            <p>It's true indeed, other of our <hi>Engliſh Gods</hi> have <hi>died like men,</hi> like mean, baſe and ple<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>beian
<pb n="5" facs="tcp:99498:4"/>fellows: but the ſecrecy of the Contri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vance and Execution of the Wickedneſs on their Royal perſons argued ſome Shame in the Authors, as being unwilling to make the Light privy to their Actions. But here, in the Tragedy of our late <hi>Sovereign</hi> of Bleſſed me<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mory, the Curtains were drawn, the Win<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dows were opened, the Scene publick, the Actors notorious, and withall ſo confident to come off with applauſe, that they were not aſhamed, <hi>Phariſee</hi>-like,<note place="margin">Matth. 6.2.</note> to <hi>ſound a Trumpet before them in the Synagogues and ſtreets,</hi> and to pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>claim in the ears of all, in the chief and Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pital City of the Nation, when and where they might behold Majeſty it ſelf firſt Ar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raigned, and afterwards Executed by a Baſe and Ignoble hand. Methinks as oft as I re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>flect upon that Diſmal day, when our <hi>Royal So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi> was <hi>led as a Lamb to the Slaughter,</hi> I can<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>not onely take up a Lamentation, but an In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dignation too againſt my ſelf and the reſt of my Countrymen, for being under ſuch a Le<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thargy of Puſillanimity and Cowardice, that the whole Nation did not riſe as one man, to reſcue ſo Noble a Captive from the hands of Tyrants. And if for any Offence the whole Kingdome ſtood in need of an Act of Oblivion
<pb n="6" facs="tcp:99498:5"/>and Pardon from the SON, ſure it was for want of Courage on that day, in not doing the utmoſt that was poſsible for the deliverance of the FATHER. But what ſhall we ſay? <hi>The ſtout-hearted were</hi> then <hi>all fallen aſleep,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Pſal. 76.5.</note>

            </p>
            <p>Methinks I hear my <hi>dead Sovereign</hi> expoſtu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lating wich his unnatural Children in the words of King <hi>David, Pſal.</hi> 55.12, 13, 14. <hi>It was not an Enemy that reproched me; then I could have born it: neither was it he that hated me that did magnifie himſelf againſt me; then I would have hid my ſelf from him.

We know well enough from what Magazine the Powder was fetched to blow up King and Parliament; from what Armory <hi>Clement</hi> and <hi>Pavilliac</hi> were furniſhed with Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gers to ſheath them in the Bowells of their

            <p>Now that we may have plenty of water this day, I have thought good to invite you to ſit down by <hi>Jeremiah</hi>'s Rivers, as the <hi>Jews</hi> ſome<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>times <hi>ſate down by the waters of Babylon,</hi> and <hi>wept in the remembrance of Sion.</hi> For here in this

               <item>5 The Captivity and Baniſhment of the Prieſts and Prophets, v. 15.</item>
               <item>6 And laſtly, which brings up the Rere of this ſad Troup of Calamities, the Deſtru<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ction of the King himſelf; <hi>The Breath of our noſtrills, the Anointed of the Lord was taken in their pits.</hi>

            <p>Now here we are firſt to enquire of whom the Prophet ſpeaks, and what King he intends by theſe expreſsions. Some have thought <hi>Jo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſiah</hi> to be the perſon aimed at, who was ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken away by a violent Stroke, and his untime<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly death accompanied with an univerſal <hi>La<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentation of all Judah and Jeruſalem,</hi> and of <hi>Jere<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>miah</hi> himſelf, 2 <hi>Chron.</hi> 35.24, 25.</p>
            <p>But the ſeveral paſſages of this Chapter make it appear that it was ſuch a Prince as fell together with the City and Temple; which Character can agree to none beſide <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> the laſt Monarch that ſate upon the Throne of <hi>Judah,</hi> as may appear by comparing <hi>Jerem.</hi> 39.4, 5. with the verſe immediately preceding my
<pb n="11" facs="tcp:99498:7"/>Text. There we reade how <hi>Zedekiah</hi> made an eſcape by the Gate betwixt the two Walls, but being purſued by the <hi>Chaldean</hi> Army, (who had notice given thereof) was overtook in the plains of <hi>Jericho,</hi> and there made priſoner. Now the verſe before my Text ſeems to point at this very accident; <hi>Our perſecutours are ſwifter then the Eagles of Heaven; they purſued us upon the mountains, they laid wait for us in the wilderneſs:</hi> and then it follows,
<q>The Breath of our noſtrills—</q>
            </p>
            <p>IN theſe words the Prophet takes notice of,</p>
            <p n="1">I. The Sacredneſs of <hi>Zedekiah</hi>'s Perſon by virtue of his Office, in that he calls him <hi>The Anointed of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p n="2">II. The general and happy Influence of his Government on his people, couched under two Metaphors.</p>

               <item>1. He is compared to <hi>the Breath of our noſtrils,</hi> as much as to ſay, our very Soul and Life.</item>

            <p n="1">1. To a <hi>Tree:</hi> as <hi>Dan.</hi> 4.20, 21, 22. The Tree that <hi>Nebuchadnezzar</hi> ſaw in his Dream, great and tall, abounding with fair leaves and much fruit, to ſhelter and nouriſh the Beaſts
<pb n="12" facs="tcp:99498:8"/>that came under it, was the King himſelf, as <hi>Daniel</hi> interpreted the meaning thereof.</p>
            <p n="2">2. To a <hi>Rock, Iſai.</hi> 32. ver. 1, 2. <hi>Behold a King ſhall reign in righteouſneſs,</hi> —<hi>And he ſhall be as a great Rock in a weary Land; to be as an hiding-place from the winde, and a covert from the tempeſt.</hi> Or,</p>
            <p n="3">3. To an <hi>Hen,</hi> as ſome will have it, that gathereth her Chickens under her wings, to protect them from the ravenous Kite; for there is mention made in Scripture of <hi>the ſhadow of wings, Pſal.</hi> 36.7. and 57.1. and 63.7.</p>
            <p>Though I rather embrace the firſt Metaphor of a <hi>Tree,</hi> as moſt proper for this and other places of Scripture to ſhadow forth the Excel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lencies of Kingly Government.</p>
            <p n="3">III. The unhappy Fall of this tall Cedar, in thoſe words, <hi>was taken in their pits.</hi>

            <p n="4">IV. The unlooked-for Seaſon, viz. at ſuch a time when the <hi>Jews</hi> promiſed themſelves no ſmall Happineſs under his Government; <hi>Of whom we ſaid, Under his ſhadow we ſhall live among the Heathens.</hi> The Kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> had ſtrangely ſhifted her Princes in a little time. In the ſpace of leſs then 12 years four Kings were removed, partly by death, and partly by Depoſition. <hi>Egypt</hi> and <hi>Babylon</hi> were <hi>Judah</hi>'s
<pb n="13" facs="tcp:99498:8"/>Make-kings. And ſhe, poor Kingdome, like a Tennis-ball was bandied up and down, and driven into ſeveral ſtreights, according as thoſe two mighty Monarchs play'd their game. At laſt <hi>Babylon</hi> having gained the prize from <hi>E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gypt, Judah</hi> was in ſome hopes of a Settle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> who being of the Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Line was advanced to the Throne with the joynt conſent of <hi>Hebuchadnezzar</hi> and the <hi>Jews:</hi> but within few years, as their Riches had fled away long before, ſo now their Hopes too are upon the wing and gone; The Tree is cut down, the Rock is overturned, all the Feathers of the Wings are plucked, and the poor <hi>Jews</hi> expoſed to the wide world. <hi>The Breath of our noſtrils, the Anointed of the Lord was taken,</hi> &amp;c.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="I"/> I begin with the Firſt, viz. The Sacredneſs of <hi>Zedekiahſ</hi>'s Perſon by virtue of his Kingly Office, being ſtyled <hi>the Anointed of the Lord.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Kings are the Anointed of God: God gave commiſsion to <hi>Samuel</hi> to anoint <hi>Saul</hi> the firſt King of <hi>Iſrael,</hi>
               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 9.15, 16.</note> which accordingly he perfor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>med, chap. 10.1. <hi>Then</hi> Samuel <hi>took a vial of Oyle, and poured it upon his head, and kiſſed him, and ſaid, Is it not becauſe the Lord hath anointed thee
<pb n="14" facs="tcp:99498:9"/>to be Captain over his Inheritance?</hi> Hence is <hi>Saul</hi> called <hi>the Anointed of the Lord</hi> by <hi>David</hi> often: After the Rejection of <hi>Saul</hi> by God, <hi>Samuel</hi> is authorized by God to doe the like unto <hi>Da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vid,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.1. and did ſo, v. 13. And of this ſolemn Conſecration to the Royal Office <hi>David</hi> ſpeaks, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.19, 20. <hi>Then thou ſpakeſt in a viſion to thy holy one,</hi> (viz. <hi>Samuel</hi>) <hi>and ſaideſt, I have laid help upon one that is mighty: I have exalted one choſen out of the people. I have found</hi> David <hi>my Servant; with my holy Oyle have I anointed him.</hi> And hence in many of the Pſalms <hi>David</hi> ſtyles himſelf <hi>the Anointed of the Lord.</hi> And becauſe <hi>David</hi>'s Succeſſors had the like honourable Ceremonies done unto them, thereupon they might challenge the ſame ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable Title. Neither was this Ceremony of Anointing proper onely to <hi>David</hi> and his Succeſſors, but other Kings likewiſe had the ſame Honour done unto them by the ſpecial warrant of God; as namely <hi>Jehu</hi> and <hi>Hazael.</hi> Now the Effuſion of Oyle upon their heads did betoken,</p>
            <p n="1">1. The pouring out of a ſpirit of Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment and Courage upon them beyond what they were ordinarily endued withall before their Aſſumption to the Crown; as appears
<pb n="15" facs="tcp:99498:9"/>in <hi>Saul</hi> and <hi>David,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.6, 9, 10. and ch. 11.6. And of this laſt it is expreſly ſaid, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 16.13. that <hi>The Spirit of the Lord came upon him from that day forward,</hi> viz. the day of his Anointing. And as by this Ceremony of pouring out Oyle upon the head was ſignified the pouring out of a ſpirit of Government up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on the perſon ſo conſecrated; ſo withall,</p>
            <p n="2">2. The Dignity and Sacredneſs of their Perſons. <hi>With mine holy Oyle have I anointed him,</hi> doth <hi>David</hi> bring in God ſpeaking con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cerning himſelf, <hi>Pſal.</hi> 89.20. The Perſon there<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore being anointed with holy Oyle becomes after a ſort Holy, ſo as not to be rudely or prophanely treated either with hand, or tongue, or thoughts; <hi>Curſe not the King, no not in thy thoughts,</hi> Eccl. 10.20. Much leſs ought his Life to be raviſhed from him by a ſtroke of pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tended Juſtice. Nay the very Garments of Kings call for Reverence and Reſpect from us; elſe what need <hi>David</hi>'s heart have ſmote him for but cutting off the skirt of <hi>Saul</hi>'s Garment?<note place="margin">1 Sam. 24.5, 6.</note> which was done upon no worſe deſign then to give <hi>Saul</hi> an earneſt of his unſpotted Loy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>alty towards him. Say not it was want of wiſedome or courage in <hi>David</hi> to let his Ene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>my eſcape, when the Cave furniſhed him with
<pb n="16" facs="tcp:99498:10"/>ſo fair an advantage againſt him. Time was, when you might have ſeen <hi>David</hi> ſo hardy as to dare to take a King by the Beard, 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 17. and kill him; but it was a King of Beaſts, not of Men, viz. a Lion. A Lion and a Bear were both worſted by <hi>David.</hi> Yea a tall and mighty Giant in the field, big enough to eat him up at a bit, could not daunt little <hi>David,</hi> armed indeed weakly, with a Sling and a few ſmall Stones, but backed ſtrongly, with <hi>the Name of the Lord,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Prov. 18.10.</note> which <hi>is a ſtrong Tower.</hi> Onely a King in a Cave makes <hi>David</hi>'s Sword to fall out of his hand, and his heart too to faint. And obſerve when it was that <hi>David</hi> held his hand; when <hi>Saul</hi> was covering his feet in the Cave. Strange! when our Earthly Gods betray moſt of man and humane infirmity, even then there ſhould ſuch a Majeſty appear in their Perſons as to command the Swords and Hearts of all Loyal Subjects. So again, ch. 26.7, 8. when King <hi>Saul</hi> at another time lay at the mercy of <hi>David,</hi> being faſt aſleep, and <hi>Abner</hi> the Gene<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ral of his Army in the ſame poſture, (who therefore deſerved the reward of that <hi>Thebane</hi> Sentinel, who being found aſleep by <hi>Epaminon<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>das</hi> was diſpatched by him, with this Memento, <hi>Dead I found thee, and dead I leave thee</hi>) when
<pb n="17" facs="tcp:99498:10"/>
               <hi>Saul,</hi> I ſay, lay faſt aſleep, <hi>Abiſhai</hi>'s ſtomach was ſharp ſet, and very earneſt to fall aboard him: but <hi>David</hi> withholds him, with this ſtrong Cord, v. 9. <hi>Deſtroy him not; for who can ſtretch forth his hand againſt the Lord's Anointed, and be guiltleſs?</hi> Who can, and be guiltleſs? Sure if any might have made bold with <hi>Saul</hi>'s life, <hi>David</hi> was the man, being a King himſelf, and ſo <hi>Saul</hi>'s peer and equal, and having a better Title to the Crown then <hi>Saul,</hi> ſince God had rejected him, chap. 16.1. But <hi>David</hi> cannot perſuade himſelf to thruſt his Prince out of the Saddle, that he may mount up. Rather he will at<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tend and wait God's leiſure, and not ſtoop to take up that Crown, which being at all times lined with Thorns, doth then prick moſt when the Thorns are ſteeped in Royal bloud.</p>
            <p>Yea, but I hear a muttering of ſome Patrons of our Regicides: We are as much againſt King-killing in a Cave as <hi>David;</hi> we abhor to give our Prince either a <hi>Spaniſh</hi> Figg or Dag<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ger; we never once encouraged any to Aſſaſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſinate or ſtab our <hi>Sovereign;</hi> we leave ſuch practices to ſuch as have been tutored thereun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to in the <hi>Jeſuites</hi> Chamber of Meditation; we acknowledge in this reſpect the Lives of Kings to be as conſecrate Corn,<note place="margin">J. G.</note> fit onely to be reaped
<pb n="18" facs="tcp:99498:11"/>by the hand of God. But for a Prince that hath bathed his Sword in the Bloud of his Sub<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jects to have a fair Trial in open Court, and afterwards to have Juſtice done upon him by virtue of that ancient Law of God, <hi>He that ſheddeth man's bloud, by man ſhall his bloud be ſhed,</hi> cannot juſtly be parallel'd with <hi>Romiſh</hi> and <hi>Je<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſuitical</hi> practices, who murther with white-powder, and kill without making any noiſe.</p>
            <p>But who is ſo great a ſtranger in our <hi>Iſrael</hi> as to be ignorant what kinde of Trial our <hi>Graci<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ous Sovereign</hi> underwent? Who knows not that his Judges were his ſworn Enemies and for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſworn Rebells? Who knows not that our <hi>So<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vereign</hi>'s Death was decreed before ever their High Court was erected, which was onely to adde Mockery to their Malice, as was obſer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ved by our late <hi>Sovereign?</hi> Who knows not what bloudy purveyors were ſent up and down the Nation to procure hands to Peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tions, which the poor Subſcriber never heard nor read? onely the mention of Juſtice upon Delinquents from higheſt to loweſt blinded the eyes of ſome, perhaps honeſt and well<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>meaning, but yet ſilly men, that they could not ſee to the bottom of that Helliſh Deſign, who otherwiſe would have ſhriek'd aloud, to
<pb n="19" facs="tcp:99498:11"/>have ſeen the Devil appear at noon-day with his cloven foot. And whereas it is ſaid that bloud muſt goe for bloud; I grant it, if un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>derſtood aright, viz. ſo it be ordered to be ſhed by the Magiſtrate, that is authorized thereunto by Commiſsion from the Supreme Magiſtrate: for otherwiſe if any men may take the Sword of Juſtice in their hands, they will be ſure to doe Injuſtice; our <hi>hands</hi> then, like <hi>Iſhmael</hi>'s, will be lifted up <hi>against every man, and every mans hand againſt</hi> us. If the King be Supreme, then ſure I am the People are inferiour; and if it be an undoubted Max<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ime, that <hi>Par in parem non habet poteſtatem,</hi> then certainly the Inferior, though they may have Power, yet can challenge no Authority over the Superior. The truth is, had either the Law of God, or of Nature, or of the Land been conſulted withall, the Sacred Perſon of a <hi>King</hi> would never have been made ſo cheap, nor His Head ſevered from His Body on ſuch eaſie terms. If either <hi>Moſes</hi> or <hi>Daniel</hi> or <hi>David</hi> or <hi>Paul</hi> might have been allowed to have been of His <hi>Majeſtie</hi>'s Counſel, and heard as Advo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cates on His Royal behalf; I am ſure He would have been acquitted at their Mock-Court. <hi>Moſes</hi> ſaith, <hi>Thou ſhalt not revile the Gods,</hi>

And this brings me to the conſideration of the Se<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cond remarkable in the Text.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="II"/> Secondly, The happy Influence of <hi>Zedeki<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ah</hi>'s, and ſo of all Kingly Government, diſplay<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed in two Metaphors.</p>
            <p n="1">1. It is compared to the <hi>Breath of our noſtrills.</hi> The Phraſe is taken from <hi>Gen.</hi> 2.7. where we reade <hi>the Lord formed Man out of the duſt of the ground, and breathed into his noſtrills the breath of life, and Man became a living Soul.</hi> It ſeems by this expreſſion, that Kings are as Souls to actuate and enliven the great Bodies of people, which without them would be but as ſo many Corpſes when once the breath is gone. As when God made <hi>Adam</hi> of Clay or Red earth, he is ſaid to <hi>breathe into his noſtrills the breath of life, and ſo Man became a living Soul:</hi> ſo when God erects a Nation into an orderly Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, but eſpecially a Kingdome or Monar<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chy, then are we a living Soul, and breathe in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deed. Well may then their Memory ſtink and
<pb n="22" facs="tcp:99498:13"/>rot amongſt us, that made Three famous Kingdoms become ſo many ſtinking Carca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſes: They muſt needs be ſo when their breath was ſtopt. And how juſt is God in taking away their breath, that robbed Three Nati<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons of their breath at once? And it is worth obſerving, That theſe Three Kingdoms could never thrive till they did breathe again towards Monarchy under a thing called a <hi>Protector.</hi> But indeed his breath could not agree with our <hi>Engliſh</hi> bodies. His breath was too hot, it did rather ſcorch then cool the body; and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing more Artificial then Natural, for his Head was only faſtned to the Body by an Inſtrument, it could not animate the Body long; ſo that within a few years the Three Nations lay a gaſping and panting for breath, and were in a manner giving up the Ghoſt, when God in rich Mercy was pleaſed to inſpire a new Life into us, in raiſing up our preſent <hi>Sovereign</hi> to be unto us as Life from the Dead.</p>
            <p n="2">2. Kingly Government is compared to a <hi>Tree,</hi> not a naked one, without Branches or Leaves, but ſuch an one as is ſtored with plen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ty of Leaves for <hi>Shadow,</hi> and Fruit for Food: <hi>Of whom we ſaid, Under his Shadow we ſhall live.</hi> Like that fair, tall and well-ſpread Tree in
<pb n="23" facs="tcp:99498:13"/>
               <hi>Dan.</hi> 4. whoſe <hi>leaves</hi> were <hi>fair and fruit much, for all the Beaſts that came under it.</hi> Not a Bramble or Thorn, which in ſtead of affor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding Covert and Nouriſhment, will ſcratch and tear the Fleſh of thoſe poor Sheep that ſeek for ſhelter under their boughs. Not the poiſo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nous Yew, whole melancholick ſhade is repor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted by ſome deadly to thoſe that ſit under it. Theſe may be fit Emblems of Democratical and Protectorian Government: But the Tree under which <hi>Judah</hi> of old and <hi>England</hi> of late ſate was the ſpreading Vine, that together with the broad Leaves affords thick cluſters of Grapes, which yield <hi>Wine to chear the Heart of God and man;</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 9.13.</note> The goodly Cedar, whoſe wood ſends forth an odoriferous Savour; The Roy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al Oak, that abounds in Maſt as well as Leaves. Or, <hi>As the Apple-tree is amongst the Trees of the wood, ſo</hi> was our <hi>Beloved amongſt the Sons.</hi> We <hi>ſate down under his ſhadow with great delight, and his fruit</hi> was <hi>ſweet to</hi> our <hi>taſte,</hi> Cant. 2.3.</p>
            <p>
               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="III"/> I come to the conſideration of the Third Particular, which is the unhappy Fall of <hi>Ju<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dah</hi>'s Royal Cedar: He <hi>was taken in their pits,</hi> that is, <hi>ex inſidiis.</hi> The old Tranſlation, a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>greeable to the <hi>Chaldee</hi> Paraphraſe, renders it
<pb n="24" facs="tcp:99498:14"/>

But whether we render the Hebrew word by <hi>Pits</hi> or <hi>Nets,</hi> is not material; they are both Metaphors taken from Hunters, that ſometimes make Pits and cover them with boughs and earth, to intrap the Deer and other Game, and ſometimes ſpread their Nets, to intangle them.

Oh the Tears that then did bedew and moiſten every fair and roſy Cheek, to ſee Royal bloud prodigally ſpilt upon the Ground, which a Vial of the pureſt Gold had been but too mean to receive! The whole Nation ſeemed to be as a woman in travail, followed with thick throes and pangs,

               <note place="margin">1 Sam. 4.21.</note> One would think that what <hi>Jeremiah</hi> reported concerning the Daugh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter of <hi>Zion,</hi> had been rather the complaint of <hi>England;</hi> Chap. 4. 31. <hi>I have heard the voice of a woman in travail, and the anguiſh of her that bringeth forth her firſt Child; the voice of the Daughter of</hi> Zion, <hi>that bewaileth her ſelf, that ſpreadeth her hands, ſaying, Woe is me now, for my ſoul is wearied becauſe of Murtherers.</hi> And well might men be weary of this world, and be deſirous to bid their neighbours good<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>night, when the bright Sun was not onely ſet in a dark Cloud, but even fallen from the Firmament. Or if we were ſo happy as to enjoy any light, 'twas but what Meteors and Comets and Blazing-ſtars lent us, which did rather aſtoniſh then comfort, as being Ominous, and threatning Battels and Bloud to follow not long after their appearance. And, which added to the Miſeries of our Nation, the Ship of our Commonwealth had the ill hap to be wrecked in the very mouth of the Haven.

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="IV"/> Fourthly, The unlooked-for Seaſon when <hi>Judah</hi>'s Lion was taken in their pits: <hi>Of whom we ſaid, Under his ſhadow we ſhall live.</hi> The poor Kingdome of <hi>Judah</hi> had been exerciſed with ſtrange Convulſions in a ſhort time, ſo that her ſpirits were almoſt ſpent; ſhe was now in hope to recover ſome meaſure of Strength and Beauty under <hi>Zedekiah,</hi> whom the King of <hi>Babylon</hi> had appointed to take care of his Patient. But, alas! it proved but as a lightning before Death. <hi>Judah</hi>'s Peace and Proſperity was as ſhort-lived as her own and her Siſter's <hi>Goodneſs, Hoſ.</hi> 6.4. No more then <hi>a morning Cloud or an early Dew, that quickly vaniſheth away.</hi> And this was not the leaſt aggravation of their Unhappineſs, that their Hopes were high and ſtrong to the contrary.</p>
            <p>And <hi>England</hi>'s Diſappointment herein runs parallel'd with <hi>Judah</hi>'s. Whilſt <hi>King</hi> and People were treating of a match with mutual conſent,
<pb n="28" facs="tcp:99498:16"/>and had proceeded ſo far as to be contracted each to other; then our boiſterous Blades make uſe of <hi>Alexander</hi>'s Sword to cut aſunder that Knot, which they were not able otherwiſe to untie. When the whole Kingdome was think<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing of nothing but <hi>beating</hi> their <hi>Swords into plough<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhares, and</hi> their <hi>Spears into pruning-hooks,</hi> our Enemies are converting their Swords into Mattocks and Axes, to cut down our Cedar and grub up her Roots. The Kingdome was ſo Drunk with Bloud, that ſhe did even reel and ſtagger, and was therefore the more wil<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling to take her Reſt, when our mighty <hi>Nim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rods</hi> had not yet quenched their Thirſt, and therefore are reſolved to drink hard and to purpoſe: Begin with the beſt Wine firſt, the Bloud of their <hi>King;</hi> and if that be not enough, let the bloud of Nobles and Miniſters and Commons be brewed together, to make a full Draught. <hi>Deliver</hi> us <hi>from bloud-guiltineſs, O God,</hi> and let thoſe who either plotted or con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſented to the Effuſion of ſo much innocent bloud, bleed inwardly this day, and let the bloud of thy Son <hi>ſpeak better things then the bloud of</hi> our <hi>Sovereign.</hi> And herein it becomes us to imitate a Copy ſet us by our <hi>Sovereign,</hi> whoſe Royal Heart and Pen firſt tranſcribed it from
<pb n="29" facs="tcp:99498:16"/>the practice of our Saviour. He praied for his Enemies in theſe words, <hi>Father, forgive them, for they know not what they doe:</hi> Our Royal <hi>Sovereign</hi> put up the ſame requeſt for His Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſecutors, though He could not back it with the ſame Reaſon, <hi>They know not what they doe.</hi> They knew too too well that they went about to deſtroy the Lord's Anointed. But oh what pathetical words dropt from the mouth of our dying Swan! as they are tranſmitted to us in His moſt Excellent Book, and in that Part where, having preached His own Funeral Sermon, He praied for a bleſsing upon what had been delivered, in theſe words.</p>

               <p>Though they think my Kingdomes on Earth too little to entertain at once both them and Me; yet let the capacious King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dome of thy infinite mercy at laſt receive both Me and mine Enemies.</p>

            <p>We have now run over the ſad paral<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lel of <hi>Judah</hi>'s and <hi>England</hi>'s late Miſeries, but we have not taken notice of the Cauſe. But <hi>Jeremiah</hi> will acquaint you with that too in relation to <hi>Judah, Lamentat.</hi> 5.16. <hi>The Crown is fallen from our head; Woe unto us that we have Sinned.</hi> And herein muſt <hi>England</hi> joyn hands with <hi>Judah,</hi> and hold them up at the Barre of God's Juſtice, and confeſs Guilty. But what were the Sins of <hi>England</hi> that made the Crown ſit ſo looſe? Our Church hath prudently left every man to ſearch into his own heart, and to ſmite upon his own thigh; and therefore God forbid that we ſhould recriminate one another: Onely I am afraid that ſome among us might drink away our <hi>King</hi>'s Life, by drinking too too of<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten his Health; and ſome might bring a Curſe upon the Life of our <hi>Sovereign</hi> by Curſing their God. Too many undervalued his Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon and Government, and ſaid, with thoſe children of <hi>Belial</hi> in 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 10.27. <hi>How ſhall this man ſave us? and they deſpiſed him</hi> in their hearts. And others, that were forward enough to draw out a Sword in his Defence, were wanting to make uſe of the ſhield of Faith, and by joyning the aſſiſtence of earneſt Praier,
<pb n="31" facs="tcp:99498:17"/>offer an holy Violence to Heaven, that none might be done to the Sacred Perſon of God's Anointed here on Earth. And herein all <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> failed: for otherwiſe had our Faith been ſtrong and our Praiers fervent, why might not the edge of the Axe have been blunted, or at leaſt turned ſome other way? <hi>Si Fides transferre poſsit Montem , poteſt &amp; Militem,</hi> ſaid <hi>Tertullian</hi> of old, when he encouraged the Chriſtians to keep their Dominicals, not<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>withſtanding they were threatned to be way<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lay'd by the Souldiery when they ſhould re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhrt to their Aſſemblies. And what may we hereby learn, but that if we deſire to ap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>prove our ſelves faithfull Subjects to our Prince, we muſt have a care leſt we be found Traitors and Rebells againſt God? for, as <hi>Samuel</hi> told the <hi>Iſraelites, If you doe wickedly,</hi>

            <p n="1">1. How needfull it is to maintain continu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>al watch over our own Hearts, and to be dai<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly in the Exerciſe of Grace. There is no Prince can be ſafe, unleſs the Traitor in our own. Hearts be firſt ſuppreſſed.

<pb n="35" facs="tcp:99498:19"/>am, he that hates his Prince is not onely a Traitor, but a King-killer. I am confident that if any ſhould have told thoſe Unhappy men that ſate in Judgement upon their <hi>King,</hi> a few years before, that they would in a ſhort time attempt to take away the Life of their <hi>Sovereign,</hi> they would have been ready to have ſent a Challenge to him that ſhould entertain ſuch a Suſpicion of them;<note place="margin">2 King. 8.13.</note> and <hi>Hazael</hi>'s an<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer to <hi>Eliſha</hi> would then have been in eve<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ry one of their mouths, What, <hi>are we Dogs, that we ſhould doe ſuch a thing?</hi> and yet in a few years they are metamorphoſed into that ſhape they ſo much abhorred, and learned not onely to grin and bark againſt, but likewiſe to bite and devour <hi>Majeſty</hi> it ſelf.

            </p>
            <p n="2">2. To adore the Righteous Judgement of God, in <hi>bringing the wheel over</hi> thoſe men that digged the <hi>Pit</hi> for their <hi>Sovereign. Righteous art thou, O Lord, and Juſt are thy Judgements.</hi> We ſhall now no longer be tempted with <hi>Jeremy,</hi>

               <milestone type="tcpmilestone" unit="unspecified" n="4"/> Fourthly, How often are men diſappointed of their Hopes , even when they are entring upon the fruition of them? <hi>Judah</hi>'s people of old not onely thought, but ſaid of their King, <hi>Under his ſhadow we ſhall live among the Heathens.</hi> And <hi>England</hi> ſaid as much of her <hi>King,</hi> at the time of the Treaty in the Iſle of <hi>Wight, Under his ſhadow we ſhall live.</hi> But our Hopes were blaſted by the Almighty, and like the Fig-tree in the Goſpel preſently withered away.<note place="margin">Jer. 8.15, 16, 17.</note>
